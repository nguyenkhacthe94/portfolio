# The 3-2-1-1-0 Backup Rule: Protecting Your Most Valuable Asset

Data is the most important asset of more and more companies. To protect data from dangerous risks such as hackers and ransomware, a solid backup strategy is one of the must-do things for your database. First, we have the 3-2-1 rule.

## The 3-2-1 Rule

### At least 3 copies of the data

If you have only 1 copy of the data, what could happen if that copy is corrupted/broken?

Your data is much safer with 2 or more copies on different devices. If 1 or 2 copies are broken due to a disaster or an attack, the other one will help you to recover your data.

### 2 different media

The backup is meaningless if all copies are on the same media because if it's broken/corrupted, all of your backup data is lost. So it would be much better to store your copies on different media. It's recommended to store 1 on your internal device, and 1 on your detachable device or NAS.

### At least 1 on an offsite location

Ransomware can attack all of the devices within a system. If this case happens, the offsite location copy is your lifesaver. You can store a copy using a certified cloud service or an offline storage device.

## What about the 1-0?

### At least 1 copy is offline

If you're on the internet, you can be attacked. So it would be much safer to save your copy in offline storage.

### There must be no error with the backup copy/tool/software

Everything is meaningless if the copies don't contain enough data, or the backup tool cannot read the copy properly. Everything must be verified carefully before saving/using. The backup copies must be monitored along with the database to ensure that nothing could go wrong with the backup.

## Summary

The **3-2-1-1-0 rule** ensures comprehensive data protection:

- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different storage media
- **1** offsite location
- **1** offline copy
- **0** errors in backups

By following this rule, you create multiple layers of protection against data loss, ensuring your business can recover from any disaster.
