                    Data is the most important asset of more and more companies. To protect data from dangerous risks
                    such as hackers and ransomware, a solid backup strategy is one of the must-do things for
                    your database. First, we have the 3-2-1 rule.

                <h2>The 3-2-1 Rule</h2>

                <h3>At least 3 copies of the data</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have only 1 copy of the data, what could happen if that copy is corrupted/broken?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your data is much safer with 2 or more copies on different devices. If 1 or 2 copies are broken due
                    to a
                    disaster or an attack, the other one will help you to recover your data.
                </p>

                <h3>2 different media</h3>
                <p>
                    The backup is meaningless if all copies are on the same media because if it's broken/corrupted, all
                    of
                    your backup data is lost. So it would be much better to store your copies on different media. It's
                    recommended to store 1 on your internal device, and 1 on your detachable device or NAS.
                </p>

                <h3>At least 1 on an offsite location</h3>
                <p>
                    Ransomware can attack all of the devices within a system. If this case happens, the offsite location
                    copy
                    is your lifesaver. You can store a copy using a certified cloud service or an offline storage
                    device.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>What about the 1-0?</h2>

                <h3>At least 1 copy is offline</h3>
                <p>
                    If you're on the internet, you can be attacked. So it would be much safer to save your copy in
                    offline
                    storage.
                </p>

                <h3>There must be no error with the backup copy/tool/software</h3>
                <p>
                    Everything is meaningless if the copies don't contain enough data, or the backup tool cannot read
                    the copy
                    properly. Everything must be verified carefully before saving/using. The backup copies must be
                    monitored
                    along with the database to ensure that nothing could go wrong with the backup.
                </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The <strong>3-2-1-1-0 rule</strong> ensures comprehensive data protection:</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>The Complete Backup Strategy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>3</strong> copies of your data</li>
                        <li><strong>2</strong> different storage media</li>
                        <li><strong>1</strong> offsite location</li>
                        <li><strong>1</strong> offline copy</li>
                        <li><strong>0</strong> errors in backups</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    By following this rule, you create multiple layers of protection against data loss, ensuring your
                    business
                    can recover from any disaster.
